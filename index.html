  <h2>은삼이네</h2>
  My name is <strong>Sungkeun <u>Joh</u></strong>.
  <p><a href="http://goodtvbible.goodtv.co.kr/bible.asp" target="_blank" title="성경검색엔진">1.  In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</a>
  2.  Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep,
  and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.</p>

  4.  God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.
  5.  God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." And there was evening,
  and there was morning -- the first day.
  6.  And God said, "Let there be an expanse between the waters to separate water from water."
  <p style="margin-top:55px;">7.  So God made the expanse and separated the water
    under the expanse from the water above it. And it was so.
  8.  God called the expanse "sky." And there was evening, and there was morning -- the second day.
  9.  And God said, "Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear." And it was so.
  10.  God called the dry ground "land," and the gathered waters he called "seas." And God saw that it was good.</p>
